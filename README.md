# Project-Numerical-Analysis-MATH352-
This Project is a Real Problem we use Numerical Methods to solve (ODE) and analysis this problem 
We analysis and applecation newotn's law for cooling 
use numerical methods for solve equation for cooling and plot relation between temperature and time
Methods are we use:
Forward Euler
Modified Euler
Backward Euler
Runge-Kutta 2 (RK2)
Runge-Kutta 4 (RK4)
Adams-Bashforth
Adams-Moulton
We add Exact solution 
all code we write in Octave
